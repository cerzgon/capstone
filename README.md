# capstone
A capstone mern stack project called 'Cyber Hack'.
Cyber Hack aims to educate and enable charities to protect their computer and information systems by connecting organizations with volunteering 
cyber security professionals through the Cyber Hack web application. The volunteers will be Canadian Veterans who will be newly trained and seeking 
relevant experience in their new cybersecurity profession. The first objective will be to connect volunteers with individual NGOs to provide services 
through CRUD functionality of the website.  Charities / NGOs can solicit cyber security services (i.e., create a service request) and the cyber security 
specialist can action the request (ie., read, update, or delete upon completion).  The second objective is to educate and enable charities through 
the blog. 

Contributions to this project
* [x] a logger to the server connection, it outputs error log files to the log folder in the backend directory.  
* [x] A splash screen for the server if it boots up before the frontend to indicate it is 'CyberHack'.  
* [x] Unified the theme and some of the photos and and provided terminology that references the nature of the site.  
* [x] Volunteers are cyber security experts and the clients are charities.  The charities sign up for services and they can submit service requests and view them.  When they are complete they can be deleted by the volunteer.  
* [x] Repaired deadlines (i.e., research and blog page) and placed appropriate content.  I renamed the blog page ‘service requests’. 
* [x] I did create the CRUD functionality as a separate project first and it works fine.  I have it linking with mongodb and compass and a local .  I can create, read, update and delete entries from the database.
* [x] the .env file contains a local hosted server address (i.e., localhost:27017/Cruds), this can be changed to MongoDB atlas if needed.
