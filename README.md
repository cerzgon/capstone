## Project: 
A group capstone project called 'Cyber Hack'
## Description:
Cyber Hack aims to educate and enable charities to protect their computer and information systems by connecting organizations with volunteering cyber security professionals through the Cyber Hack web application. The volunteers will be Canadian Veterans who will be newly trained and seeking relevant experience in their new cybersecurity profession. The first objective will be to connect volunteers with individual NGOs to provide services 
through CRUD functionality of the website.  Charities / NGOs can solicit cyber security services (i.e., create a service request) and the cyber security 
specialist can action the request (ie., read, update, or delete upon completion).  The second objective is to educate and enable charities through 
the blog. 
## Contributions:
The following are the contributions made by the author:
* [x] Implementation of a logger to the server connection, which outputs error log files to the log folder in the backend directory.
* [x] Development of a splash screen for the server, to indicate that it is 'CyberHack', in case it boots up before the frontend.
* [x] Unification of the theme and some of the photos and terminology that reference the nature of the site.
* [x] Use of appropriate terminology, where volunteers are referred to as cyber security experts and clients as charities. The charities can sign up for services, submit service requests, and view them. The volunteer can read, update or delete the service requests upon completion.
* [x] Repair of deadlinks (i.e., research and blog page) and placement of appropriate content. The blog page was renamed as 'service requests'.
* [x] Creation of the CRUD functionality and successful linking with MongoDB and Compass, with the ability to create, read, update, and delete entries from the database.
* [x] Inclusion of the .env file containing a local hosted server address (i.e., localhost:27017/Cruds), which can be changed to MongoDB atlas if needed.
