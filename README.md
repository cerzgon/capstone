# capstone
A capstone mern stack project called 'Cyber Hack'.
Cyber Hack aims to educate and enable charities to protect their computer and information systems by connecting organizations with volunteering 
cyber security professionals through the Cyber Hack web application. The volunteers will be Canadian Veterans who will be newly trained and seeking 
relevant experience in their new cybersecurity profession. The first objective will be to connect volunteers with individual NGOs to provide services 
through CRUD functionality of the website.  Charities / NGOs can solicit cyber security services (i.e., create a service request) and the cyber security 
specialist can action the request (ie., read, update, or delete upon completion).  The second objective is to educate and enable charities through 
the blog.
